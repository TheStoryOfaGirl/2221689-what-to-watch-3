    comment: 'This movie is just plain bad. There must be some big payola going round this awards season. Badly written, average acting at best, all the characters are unrelatable and inlikeable. 2 hours of my life wasted.',

    comment: 'It was well acted, directed, and the music was good. But the story is yawn. Not trying to rip anybody but I checked my watch a dozen times during this movie.',

    comment: 'The editing is a mess, and the transitions of the plot or characters are rather strange. There is no narrative focus and the storytelling is unbalanced. I cannot really understand why such a bad movie received an overwhelming approval from the critics. ',
